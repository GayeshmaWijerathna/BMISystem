###
BMI is calculated by dividing an adults’s weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.  For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.

BMI Categories:

Underweight = <18.5 kg/m2 (your body is less than the normal recommended weight. you need to eat more nutritious food with adequate exercises.)
Normal weight = 18.5 kg/m2 – 24 kg/m2 (Your weight is within the normal recommended weight. Maintain your weight with adequate exercises.)
Overweight = 25 kg/m2 – 30 kg/m2 (Your weight is more than the normal recommended weight. Bring down it with more exercises and correct dietary practices.)
Obesity = BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater (Your weight is very much higher than the normal recommended weight and is a risk factor for many other diseases like diabetes and heart diseases. Bring down it with more exercises, correct dietary practices and medical advices.)
